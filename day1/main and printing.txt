Every C++ program must have exactly one global function named main(). The program starts by executing that function and returns its value to the system.
	
	int main(){ … }

Main() does not have to have the return type of int, however it’s a widely accepted convention to always return a 0 (successful completion number) at the end of the function. If no value is returned, the system will receive a value indicating a successful completion. Non-zero values indicate failure.

Printing:
To print a string out to the shell in C++, you need to access std class’ property “cout”. Std can be imported to your script the following way:

	#include<iostream>

Then to print something, access the function the following way:
	
	std::cout << “Hello World”;

Note that iostream needs to be imported in order for the program to be able to print anything. 

For improved readability, the above example can be simplified in a way that omits mentioning of “std” every time you want to print something. To do so, you need to import std’s properties like so:
	
	using namespace std;

Once that line’s in, the printing can be simplified:

	cout << “Hello world”;
